# Setup
To host the API yourself, just run these commands in a terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/Xenorio/ScamAway-API
cd ScamAway-API
npm i
npm start
```

## Requirements
- [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org)

## Post-Setup
The API does not support SSL by itself. If you want SSL (strongly recommended), use a reverse proxy.
